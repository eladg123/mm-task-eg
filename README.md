# mm-task
 
Hello,

This project allows you to visit my nice shop.
There is an option to select date, and then the table will filter for show you which products are available to collect at this date.

The techniques I decided to work with is react-redux because it is more convenient to work for me, the redux helped me inject any data that I need to every component.
This project design by tailwindCSS and google fonts.
